REMARKS:

ANSWERS:

Question 1:


Question 2:

Advantages:
1. Memory and resource management is made easier and more beneficial -
when a tab is closed (or minimized\hidden), its resources can
be freed or shared among other currently-active processes.
2. Bugs and crashes are focused to the specific tab (=process), thus giving 
the browser a more stable performance that can 'survive' tab-specific errors.

Disadvantages:
1. As opposed to user-level threads, each process creates a lot of overhead
and is considered to be slow and inefficient.
2. Although resource management is indeed efficient in chrome's implementation,
but resource *use* and demand is greater, due to the need to store data for each of these
processes (which are not 'hidden' from the OS like user-level threads are).


Question 3.a:

Question 3.b:

Question 3.c:

Question 4:
As described in "man itimer":
Real time 'passes' as real-life time, 
while virtual time passes only when the process is executing.
We use *virtual* time in our quantum timer - it sends a signal when a virtual quantum has passed.
We use *real* time in our sleep timer - it send a signal when a real time 'unit' has passed.
