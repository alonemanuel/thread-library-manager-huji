ANSWERS:

Assignment 1:

After running the file there are two options -

1. If you supply a single argument, the program creates a directory called 'Welcome',
and inside 'Welcome' it creates another directory called 'To', and inside of that it creates a file
called 'OS2018'.
It then opens the file and writes the following text into it:
"[username]
If you haven't read the course guidelines yet --- do it right now!
[supplied argument]"
It then closes the file and deletes it, and then goes on to delete the directories in a reverse order.

2. Else, it prints the following error:
"Error. The program should receive a single argument. Exiting."
